# Age Estimator

This project is the capstone project for **Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree**.

## Getting Started

The project has two portions, the Jupyter Notebook, which contains the actual processing and training for the model, and the sample flask application using the successful model. The Jupyter notebook depends on the following:

- keras: https://keras.io/#installation
- numpy: http://www.numpy.org/
- pandas: https://pandas.pydata.org/
- matplotlib: https://matplotlib.org/

The flask application has the following dependencies:

- Dlib Installation: http://dlib.net/compile.html
- OpenCV (cv2): https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/
- keras: https://keras.io/#installation
- PIL: https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/5.3.x/installation.html
- flask: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/installation/

After installing the dependencies, the application can be run as follows:

```
cd age-estimator-app
python app.py
```

### Data Sources

The project uses the following datasets:

- **UTKFaces:** The UTKFaces dataset is available from this location: https://susanqq.github.io/UTKFace/

- **OUI-Adience:** The OUI-Adience dataset is available from this location: https://talhassner.github.io/home/projects/Adience/Adience-data.html
