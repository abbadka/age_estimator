Sample files are provided here from the full UTKFaces dataset. The dataset files can be accessed from here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BxYys69jI14kSVdWWllDMWhnN2c

Any fils with a face (a single face, otherwise the algorithm would be confused) can be added to this folder. They should be prefixed with the age followed by \_, and should be of type .jpg.
